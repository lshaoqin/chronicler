### VECTOR_DB_CONFIG.md

**VECTOR_DB_CONFIG.md Documentation**
=====================================

**Overview**
------------

The `VECTOR_DB_CONFIG.md` file is used to configure the vector database settings for Chronicler, a search engine that supports various external or self-hosted vector databases.

**Main Components**
-------------------

This file contains the following main components:

*   **Supported Vector Databases**: A list of supported vector databases, including FAISS (default), Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Qdrant, and Milvus.
*   **Configuration via Environment Variables**: Instructions on how to configure a vector database connection using environment variables in a `.env` file.

**Configuring Vector Database Connections**
------------------------------------------

To use a specific vector database with Chronicler, you need to set the `VECTOR_DB_TYPE` environment variable to the desired type (e.g., `faiss`, `pinecone`, etc.). The configuration options for each vector database are listed in the corresponding sections below:

### Pinecone Configuration

*   **Pinecone API Key**: Required for authentication.
*   **Pinecone Environment**: Specifies the region where the index will be created.
*   **Pinecone Index Name**: The name of the index to create.
*   **Pinecone Namespace**: Optional, defaults to "default".

### Weaviate Configuration

*   **Weaviate URL**: Required for authentication.
*   **Weaviate API Key**: Optional if authentication is not required.
*   **Weaviate Index Name**: The name of the index to create. Defaults to "Chronicler".
*   **Weaviate Text Key**: Optional, defaults to "content".

### Chroma Configuration

*   **Chroma Persist Directory**: Optional, defaults to "./chroma_db".
*   **Chroma Collection Name**: Optional, defaults to "chronicler".

### Qdrant Configuration

*   **Qdrant URL**: Required for authentication.
*   **Qdrant API Key**: Optional if authentication is not required.
*   **Qdrant Collection Name**: The name of the collection to create. Defaults to "chronicler".

### Milvus Configuration

*   **Milvus URI**: Required for connection.
*   **Milvus Collection Name**: The name of the collection to create. Defaults to "chronicler".
*   **Milvus Username**: Optional.
*   **Milvus Password**: Optional.

**Fallback Mechanism**
---------------------

If the connection to the configured vector database fails, Chronicler will automatically fall back to using a local FAISS vector store.

**Installation**
--------------

To use a specific vector database, you need to install the required dependencies. The necessary packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file with comments indicating which packages are needed for each vector database.

You can install only the dependencies you need. For example:

```bash
# For Pinecone
pip install pinecone-client

# For Weaviate
pip install weaviate-client

# For Chroma
pip install chromadb

# For Qdrant
pip install qdrant-client

# For Milvus
pip install pymilvus
```

**Example .env File**
---------------------

Here is an example `.env` file that demonstrates how to configure a vector database connection:

```bash
# OpenAI API Key (required for OpenAI provider)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# For Qdrant
pip install qdrant-client

# For Milvus
pip install pymilvus
```

Or, an example `.env` file that configures Pinecone:

```bash
# Vector Database Configuration
VECTOR_DB_TYPE=pinecone
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-west1-gcp
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=chronicler
```

By following these instructions and using the `VECTOR_DB_CONFIG.md` file, you can configure Chronicler to use a specific vector database.

### __overview__

# Repository Overview

**Repository Organization Analysis**
=====================================

The provided repository structure is organized into two main sections: `__files__` and `src`. Here's a breakdown of each section:

### __files__

*   The `__files__` section contains metadata files that are not part of the actual codebase. These files include:
    *   `VECTOR_DB_CONFIG.md`: A configuration file for the vector database.
    *   `requirements.txt`: A list of dependencies required by the project.
    *   `README.md`: A brief introduction to the project.
    *   `.gitignore`: A file that specifies which files should be ignored by Git.
    *   `.env.example`: An example environment variable file.
    *   `requirements.lock`: A lockfile for managing dependencies.

### src

*   The `src` section contains the actual codebase of the project. It includes:
    *   `documentation.py`: A module for generating documentation.
    *   `doc_storage.py`: A module for storing documentation.
    *   `rag_system.py`: A module for the RAG system (likely a custom implementation).
    *   `__init__.py`: An empty file that serves as a placeholder for initialization purposes.
    *   `llm_service.py`: A module for the large language model service.
    *   `vector_db_config.py`: A configuration file for the vector database.
    *   `main.py`: The main entry point of the application.
    *   `repository.py`: A module that likely interacts with the repository.

**Summary and Suggestions**
---------------------------

The repository structure is relatively straightforward, but there are a few suggestions to improve it:

*   Consider moving the metadata files (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`) into a separate directory, such as `metadata` or `config`. This would keep the codebase clean and organized.
*   The `__init__.py` file is empty; consider removing it if it's not being used for initialization purposes. If it's needed, make sure to add some content to it.
*   The `requirements.lock` file suggests that the project uses a tool like pip-compile or poetry to manage dependencies. Consider adding a script or a tool to automate dependency management and update the lockfile accordingly.
*   The `repository.py` module seems to interact with the repository; consider moving this functionality into a separate module, such as `repo_utils`, to keep the codebase organized.

**Improved Repository Structure**
---------------------------------

Here's an updated version of the repository structure incorporating the suggested improvements:

```markdown
{
  "__files__": [
    "metadata",
    "config"
  ],
  "src": {
    "__files__": [
      "documentation.py",
      "doc_storage.py",
      "rag_system.py",
      "repo_utils.py", // Move repository interaction to a separate module
      "__init__.py",
      "llm_service.py",
      "vector_db_config.py",
      "main.py"
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "__files__": [
      "VECTOR_DB_CONFIG.md",
      "requirements.txt",
      ".gitignore",
      ".env.example"
    ]
  },
  "config": {
    "__files__": [
      "requirements.lock" // Move lockfile to a separate directory
    ]
  }
}
```

This updated structure keeps the codebase organized, and makes it easier to manage dependencies and repository interactions.

## src

### __init__.py

**Initialization File Documentation**
=====================================

### Overview

The `__init__.py` file is a special Python file that serves as an entry point for packages. It is used to initialize the package's namespace and make its contents available for import.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this file is to define the package's structure, including its top-level modules and subpackages. By default, Python treats directories with an `__init__.py` file as packages, allowing them to be imported and used in other parts of the codebase.

### Main Components

This file contains the following main components:

*   **Package Name**: The package name is defined at the top of this file.
*   **Imports**: Any necessary imports are made here to ensure that the package's dependencies are properly initialized.
*   **Namespace Initialization**: This section initializes the package's namespace, making its contents available for import.

### Usage

To use this package, you can follow these steps:

1.  Install the package using pip: `pip install <package-name>`
2.  Import the package in your Python code: `import <package-name>`
3.  Access the package's contents and subpackages as needed.

**Example Use Case**
--------------------

Here is an example of how to use this package:
```python
# my_package/__init__.py

from .module1 import module1_function
from .module2 import module2_function

def init_package():
    print("Initializing package...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    init_package()
```

```python
# main.py

import my_package

my_package.module1_function()  # Output: "Initializing package..."
```
In this example, the `init_package` function is called when the script is run directly (i.e., not imported as a module). The `module1_function` is then accessed and executed.

### Conclusion

The `__init__.py` file plays a crucial role in defining the structure and behavior of Python packages. By understanding its purpose, components, and usage, you can effectively use this file to organize your codebase and make it more maintainable.

### doc_storage.py

**Documentation Storage**
========================

### Overview

The `doc_storage.py` file provides a class-based implementation for storing and managing documentation sections. It allows users to create, update, delete, and retrieve documentation sections, as well as generate full documentation by combining all sections.

### Main Components

*   **`DocSection` Class**: Represents a single documentation section.
    *   Attributes:
        *   `file_path`: Path to the file this section documents
        *   `content`: Markdown content of the section
        *   `last_updated`: Timestamp when this section was last updated
        *   `metadata`: Additional metadata for the section
*   **`DocumentationStorage` Class**: Manages a collection of documentation sections.
    *   Attributes:
        *   `base_path`: Base path for storing documentation
        *   `index`: Dictionary mapping file paths to DocSection objects

### Usage

    file_path="path/to/file.md",
    content="# Heading\n\nThis is some sample content.",
    last_updated=None,
    metadata={"author": "John Doe"}
)
storage.save_section(section)
```

#### Retrieving a Documentation Section

To retrieve a documentation section, use the `DocumentationStorage` class:

```python
storage = DocumentationStorage(base_path="/docs")
section = storage.get_section("path/to/file.md")
```

#### Generating Full Documentation

To generate full documentation by combining all sections, use the `DocumentationStorage` class:

```python
storage = DocumentationStorage(base_path="/docs")
full_documentation = storage.generate_full_documentation()
print(full_documentation)
```

### Example Use Cases

*   Creating a new documentation section:
    ```python
section = DocSection(
    file_path="path/to/file.md",
    content="# Heading\n\nThis is some sample content.",
    last_updated=None,
    metadata={"author": "John Doe"}
)

### Find Relevant Files

The LLM Service can identify relevant files based on a search query from a list of files. This method is useful for quickly identifying the most relevant files for a given query.

```python
def find_relevant_files(self, query: str, file_list: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """
    Identifies relevant files based on a search query from a list of files.
    
    Args:
        query (str): The search query to be used for identifying relevant files.
        file_list (List[str]): A list of files to be searched.
    
    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of markdown-formatted strings containing the identified relevant files.
    """
    if not file_list:
        return []
    
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(
            "You are a code search assistant. Your task is to identify the most relevant "
            "files based on a search query from a list of files."
        ),
        HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(
            "Please provide the following information:\n\n"
            "* Search query: {query}\n"
            "* List of files: {file_list}"
        )
    ])
    
    formatted_prompt = prompt.format_prompt(
        query=query,
        file_list=file_list
    )
    
    response = self.llm.invoke(formatted_prompt.to_messages())
    content = self._extract_response_content(response)
    
    try:
        # Extract JSON array from response
        result = json.loads(content)
        if isinstance(result, list):
            return result
        return []
    except:
        # Fallback: try to extract file paths from text response
        lines = content.split("\n")
        files = []
        for line in lines:
            for file in file_list:
                if file in line:
                    files.append(file)
                    break
        return files[:5]  # Return at most 5 files

# Knowledge Base
================

## Overview

This module provides a comprehensive knowledge base for searching, retrieving, and analyzing relevant documents based on user queries.

## Main Components

### 1. Document Processing

The knowledge base processes documents from various sources (e.g., files, web pages) and extracts relevant information such as text content, metadata, and context.

### 2. Vector Store Creation

A vector store is created using the extracted document data to enable efficient similarity searches.

### 3. Search Functionality

The search functionality allows users to query the knowledge base for relevant documents based on their input queries.

## Usage

### Building the Knowledge Base

To use this module, you need to build a knowledge base by calling the `build_knowledge_base()` method and passing in your document data.

```python
from knowledge_base import KnowledgeBase

# Load document data from various sources (e.g., files, web pages)
documents = ...

# Create a new instance of the KnowledgeBase class
kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Build the knowledge base by calling the build_knowledge_base() method
kb.build_knowledge_base(documents)

# Now you can use the search functionality to query the knowledge base
```

### Searching for Relevant Documents

To search for relevant documents, call the `search()` method and pass in your input query.

```python
from knowledge_base import KnowledgeBase

# Load document data from various sources (e.g., files, web pages)
documents = ...

# Create a new instance of the KnowledgeBase class
kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Build the knowledge base by calling the build_knowledge_base() method
kb.build_knowledge_base(documents)

# Search for relevant documents based on your input query
query = "example query"
results = kb.search(query, k=5)

# Print the results
for result in results:
    print(result.metadata['source'])
```

### Retrieving Context for a Specific File

To retrieve context for a specific file, call the `get_file_context()` method and pass in the file path.

```python
from knowledge_base import KnowledgeBase

# Load document data from various sources (e.g., files, web pages)
documents = ...

# Create a new instance of the KnowledgeBase class
kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Build the knowledge base by calling the build_knowledge_base() method
kb.build_knowledge_base(documents)

# Get context for a specific file based on its path
file_path = "path/to/file.txt"
context = kb.get_file_context(file_path)

# Print the context
print(context)
```

### Finding Relevant Files

To find relevant files, call the `find_relevant_files()` method and pass in your input query.

```python
from knowledge_base import KnowledgeBase

# Load document data from various sources (e.g., files, web pages)
documents = ...

# Create a new instance of the KnowledgeBase class
kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Build the knowledge base by calling the build_knowledge_base() method
kb.build_knowledge_base(documents)

# Find relevant files based on your input query
query = "example query"
results = kb.find_relevant_files(query, k=5)

# Print the results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### repository.py

**Repository Module Documentation**
=====================================

The `repository.py` module provides a class-based implementation for handling GitHub repositories. It offers various methods for cloning, indexing, and querying repository data.

**Class Overview**
-----------------

The `Repository` class is the core component of this module. It initializes a new instance with a GitHub URL or local path to the repository.

### Main Components

*   **Initialization**: The class takes a `repo_url_or_path` parameter in its constructor, which can be either a GitHub URL or a local file system path.
*   **Cloning and Loading**: The `clone_or_load()` method clones the repository from the provided URL or loads it from the specified local path. It also initializes the internal data structures for indexing files.
*   **File Indexing**: The `_index_files()` method populates an internal index of all files in the repository, including their relative paths and sizes.
*   **File Retrieval**: The `get_file_content()` method returns the content of a specific file as a string.
*   **File Filtering**: The `get_files_by_extension()` method retrieves all files with a specified extension (e.g., `.py`, `.js`).
*   **Directory Structure**: The `get_directory_structure()` method returns a dictionary representing the directory structure of the repository.
*   **Commit Analysis**: The `get_changed_files()`, `get_file_diff()`, and `get_commit_message()` methods analyze commits, retrieve file differences, and extract commit messages.

### Usage

To use this module, follow these steps:

1.  Initialize a new instance of the `Repository` class with a GitHub URL or local path to the repository.
2.  Clone or load the repository using the `clone_or_load()` method.
3.  Index all files in the repository by calling `_index_files()`.
4.  Retrieve file content, filter files by extension, or analyze commits as needed.

**Example Usage**
-----------------

```python
from repository import Repository

# Initialize a new instance with a GitHub URL
repo = Repository("https://github.com/user/repository.git")

# Clone the repository from the provided URL
repo.clone_or_load()

# Index all files in the repository
repo._index_files()

# Retrieve file content
file_content = repo.get_file_content("path/to/file.txt")
print(file_content)

# Filter files by extension
files_by_extension = repo.get_files_by_extension(".py")
print(files_by_extension)
```

**Commit Messages and Statistics**
---------------------------------

The `get_commit_summary()` method returns a dictionary containing commit information, including the hash, short hash, author, date, message, changed files, and statistics (insertions, deletions, lines, and files).

```python
commit_summary = repo.get_commit_summary("commit_hash")
print(commit_summary)
```

**Cleanup**
------------

After using the `Repository` class, it is recommended to call the `cleanup()` method to remove temporary files and restore the repository path.

```python
repo.cleanup()
```

### vector_db_config.py

**Vector Database Configuration and Connection Management**
===========================================================

The `vector_db_config.py` file provides configuration and connection management for vector databases. This module allows users to easily switch between different vector database types (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Qdrant, Milvus) using environment variables.

**Main Components**
-------------------

### VectorDBConfig Class

The `VectorDBConfig` class is the core component of this module. It initializes and manages the configuration for a specific vector database type.

*   **Initialization**: The class takes an `embedding_model` parameter, which specifies the embedding model to use for the vector database.
*   **Configuration Loading**: The class loads the configuration parameters based on the selected vector database type from environment variables.
*   **Vector Store Creation**: The class creates a vector store from documents using the configured database.

### Supported Vector Database Types

The `SUPPORTED_DBS` list specifies the supported vector database types:

*   FAISS
*   Pinecone
*   Weaviate
*   Chroma
*   Qdrant
*   Milvus

**Usage**
---------

To use this module, follow these steps:

1.  Set environment variables for the desired vector database type:
    *   `VECTOR_DB_TYPE`: specifies the vector database type (e.g., "faiss", "pinecone")
    *   Additional environment variables specific to each database type (e.g., `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `WEAVIATE_URL`)
2.  Initialize a `VectorDBConfig` instance with an embedding model:
    ```python
from langchain.embeddings.base import Embeddings

embedding_model = Embeddings("bert-base-nli-mean-tokens")
config = VectorDBConfig(embedding_model)
```
3.  Create a vector store from documents using the configured database:
    ```python
documents = ["document1", "document2"]
vector_store = config.create_vector_store(documents)
```

**Example Use Cases**
--------------------

*   **FAISS**: Create a FAISS vector store from a list of documents:
    ```python
config = VectorDBConfig(Embeddings("bert-base-nli-mean-tokens"))
documents = ["document1", "document2"]
vector_store = config.create_vector_store(documents)
```
*   **Pinecone**: Create a Pinecone vector store from a list of documents:
    ```python
config = VectorDBConfig(Embeddings("bert-base-nli-mean-tokens"))
documents = ["document1", "document2"]
vector_store = config.create_vector_store(documents)
```

**Troubleshooting**
------------------

*   **Unsupported Vector Database Type**: If an unsupported vector database type is specified, a `ValueError` exception will be raised.
*   **Incomplete Configuration**: If the configuration for a specific vector database type is incomplete (e.g., missing required environment variables), a `ValueError` exception will be raised.

By following these guidelines and using this module, you can easily switch between different vector database types and create vector stores from documents using the configured databases.
