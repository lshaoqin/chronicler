# Chronicler: A Tool for Analyzing GitHub Repositories and Generating Documentation

## Introduction

Chronicler is a tool designed to analyze GitHub repositories and generate high-quality documentation. It leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to provide insights into the repository's structure, content, and design decisions.

### Features

*   Analyzes GitHub repositories for code quality, documentation, and design decisions
*   Generates documentation based on the analysis, including README.md and suggestions for improvement
*   Supports multiple LLM providers, including OpenAI and Ollama
*   Customizable output directory and API key

## Getting Started

To use Chronicler, follow these steps:

1.  Clone or load your GitHub repository into Chronicler using the `analyze` command.
2.  Provide any necessary environment variables, such as an OpenAI API key or Ollama host URL.
3.  Run the `analyze` command with the desired output directory and LLM model provider.

### Example Usage

```bash
# Clone a GitHub repository and generate documentation
python main.py analyze --repo https://github.com/user/repository --output /path/to/output/dir

# Use OpenAI models for LLM generation
python main.py analyze --repo https://github.com/user/repository --provider openai --llm-model gpt-4o --embedding-model text-embedding-ada-002 --temperature 0.2

# Customize output directory and API key
python main.py analyze --repo https://github.com/user/repository --output /path/to/output/dir --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Documentation

### Repository Analysis

Chronicler analyzes the repository's structure, content, and design decisions to provide insights into its quality and documentation.

*   **Code Quality**: Chronicler evaluates the code's adherence to best practices, such as coding standards, testing, and security.
*   **Documentation**: Chronicler assesses the documentation's completeness, clarity, and consistency with industry standards.
*   **Design Decisions**: Chronicler provides insights into design decisions made during the repository's development, including architecture, scalability, and maintainability.

### LLM Generation

Chronicler uses large language models to generate high-quality documentation based on the analysis.

*   **LLM Providers**: Chronicler supports multiple LLM providers, including OpenAI and Ollama.
*   **Model Customization**: Chronicler allows users to customize the LLM model used for generation, including temperature and embedding models.

### Suggestions for Improvement

Chronicler provides suggestions for improving the documentation and repository's overall quality.

*   **Improvement Suggestions**: Chronicler offers actionable recommendations for enhancing code quality, documentation, and design decisions.
*   **Prioritization**: Chronicler prioritizes suggestions based on their impact and feasibility.

## Design Decisions

Chronicler provides insights into design decisions made during the repository's development.

*   **Architecture**: Chronicler assesses the repository's architecture, including scalability, maintainability, and performance.
*   **Scalability**: Chronicler evaluates the repository's ability to scale with increasing traffic and data volume.
*   **Maintainability**: Chronicler assesses the repository's maintainability, including code organization, testing, and documentation.

## Conclusion

Chronicler is a powerful tool for analyzing GitHub repositories and generating high-quality documentation. By leveraging large language models and providing insights into design decisions, Chronicler helps developers improve their code quality, documentation, and overall repository health.

### Future Development

Future development plans include:

*   **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrating Chronicler with popular CI/CD pipelines to automate the analysis and generation process.
*   **Support for Additional LLM Providers**: Adding support for additional LLM providers to expand Chronicler's capabilities.
*   **Enhanced Design Decision Analysis**: Improving the design decision analysis component to provide more detailed insights into repository architecture, scalability, and maintainability.
